# Fake-Discord

is it a plane?

is it a bird?

no its a browser bomb 



design made to look like sending messages to a user

when you run the code you are prompted to a input 

and once those inputs are done it prints a fake message, then your browser will open up 10000 times all at once and fork your os, once you reboot its fine
